This is the most straightforward and the harshest difficulty modifier you can apply and also a much bigger bonus to industry than the default sliders give.\n\nYou can also give them a 'Desperate Defense' bonus which gives a milder but a more realistic bonus.\n\nInstead of giving bonuses to specific countries, you can also set dynamic difficulty settings. This means that only countries that are at war with a player receive the selected bonuses. This is also less extreme than a bonus given to a specific country.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\nRecommendations:\n\nDifficulty settings should obviously be adjusted according to who and how you play. Four things to consider are: A) how good you are B) how easy your country is (Germany is the easiest) C) how much you exploit the game mechanics or the AI weaknesses and D) how ahistorically you play. Difficulty should be raised accordingly.\n\nAs Germany, I might use these settings if I want a fairly challenging game while not exploiting the AI too much: 50% AI attrition reduction, dynamic Desperate Defense enabled, dynamic country bonuses at Hard, USSR set to Very Hard."
