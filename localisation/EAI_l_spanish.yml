 EAI_M.1.d:0 "Keeping Japan and Nat. Spain out of Axis is both historical and helpful to the AI. It is possible for them to join Axis later depending on the war develops.\n\n"Aggressive Germany" makes the AI Germany take France for itself and invade the rest of the European minors sooner than normally."

 EAI_H.1000.d:0 "This bonus modifier is applied to any AI country at war with a player and removed once the war is over. This can be enabled at the same time with specific country bonuses and they do not stack.\n\nWhy use this? It stops the AI from building ridiculous air forces and army sizes before the war but gives their industry the necessary boost during wars to keep them challenging. It also works for any AI country and any diplomatic situation that might develop unlike the predetermined bonuses."
