Because the AI has a lot of specific weaknesses which have to be compensated for if you want an even game (assuming you are good at the game and especially if you want to play a major country). Also, some settings may be more immersive to you than others.\n\nWhat are§! §Ydynamic§! §Lsettings? It means that the mod gives these bonuses to countries depending on how the game progresses instead of just giving a permanent bonus to all AI countries. Dynamic settings are enabled for AI countries that are at war with you (a player) and are in close proximity to you or your allies.§! §YCountry-specific§! §Lsettings on the other hand are always active and do not care whether the AI is fighting another AI or a player.\n\nWhat is the§! §YBonus§! §Lsetting and how is it different from the vanilla slider bonuses? This setting is - for the most part - meant to boost the AI's industry in order to compensate for the enormous equipment losses that the AI takes during wars. The most important part of this bonus is a cost reduction to any land and air equipment that the AI is short on which is far higher than any slider bonus. That means the AI only has an easier time producing equipment that it really needs but doesn't build unrealistic stockpiles of things it doesn't need.\n\nWhat is§! §YDesperate Defense§!§L? This setting gradually increases bonuses for the AI as it gets closer to capitulation, boosting its equipment production as well as reducing division recruitment time. Similarly to the Bonus setting, Desperate Defense also boosts equipment production for equipment that the AI has deficits in.§!"
 EAI_config_DIFFUCULTY_help_2_tt:0 "Guide to Difficulty Settings (Page 2/3)\n\n§YBonus vs Desperate Defense?§! §LIt's up to you whether you want one or both. The main difference is that the Bonus setting is constantly active for the AI while Desperate Defense only activates when the AI is on the defensive. Note that equipment cost reduction does not stack when using both, only the highest of the two modifiers is used.\n\nWhat are§! §YReinforcements§!§L? It creates equipment AND divisions for the AI instead of just giving bonuses. This is a more extreme difficulty setting than any of the above and you should only use this when other settings are not enough.§!"
